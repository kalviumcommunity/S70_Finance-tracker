### Project Title:

# Finance Tracker

### Project Overview:

Finance Tracker will allow users to quickly log their incomes and expenses, view a basic balance summary, and track basic financial health over time. This version can be built with basic features to get it up and running as quickly as possible.


### key Features:
**User Registration & Login (Basic):**

**Sign Up/Login:** 
Allow users to create an account and sign in to keep their financial data private.
For simplicity, you can implement basic email/password authentication without integrating complex OAuth or 2FA.
Add Income & Expenses:

**Income:** Users can log their incoming money (salary, gift, etc.) with an amount and description.
Expenses: Users can log their expenses (e.g., groceries, bills, entertainment) with a description and amount.
Balance Calculation:

**Balance Overview:** The system automatically calculates the balance based on the income and expenses entered, showing how much money the user has at any point.
Simple Financial Summary:

**Income vs. Expenses:** Show a simple summary like "Total Income," "Total Expenses," and "Current Balance."
Display the current balance dynamically as the user adds transactions.

**Basic Data Storage:**
Use local storage (for a quicker prototype) or a basic MongoDB/SQLite database (if you need it to persist across sessions) to store transactions and user data.
Basic Dashboard:

Display a simple dashboard with the user’s current balance, recent transactions (up to 5 most recent), and a button to add new transactions.


### Tech Stack:

**Frontend:**

React.js (or Vue.js) for simplicity and quick development. React is perfect for handling dynamic UI updates (balance updates) in real-time.
CSS: Use basic CSS or frameworks like Bootstrap for simple styling, ensuring the app is user-friendly and responsive without excessive design work.

**Backend:**

Node.js with Express.js for a lightweight backend to handle transaction data and user authentication.
MongoDB (or SQLite for simplicity): Use a NoSQL database for quick setup or a local file-based SQL database for simplicity.

**Authentication:**

Use JWT (JSON Web Token) for simple and fast authentication or, if you’re in a hurry, you can implement localStorage-based authentication.


### Why This Project:
The Finance Tracker is an ideal project for several reasons, both from a practical and technical standpoint. Here's why it's an excellent choice, especially for a full-stack developer looking to showcase their skills while working on something that is valuable and interesting
